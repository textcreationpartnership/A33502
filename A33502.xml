            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Early beloved Friends, Brethren and Siſters, Babes, Lambs and Children, who are of the Election of Grace, and of the true Shepherds Fold, whom it hath pleaſed my heavenly Father in his Love, Life and Spirit, to gather out of the World, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from amongſt men, to be the firſt fruits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him, and to the LAMB, in this Day of his Power and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Appearance, and hath manifeſted his Power, and revealed his glorious Arm of Strength in and amongſt you, and hath made known his bleſſed, ſweet, refreſhing Preſence in the midſt of you, whereby you have been refreſhed, comforted and ſtrengthened in the midſt of many Trials, Tribulations and Temptations, which have been ſuffered to come upon you for the trial of your Faith ſince you were a People unto him: &amp; you know right well, that he hath not been wanting unto you in any ſtate or condition that you have been brought into, as you abode faithful unto him: And the mighty things which he hath done for you, and the great deliverances which he hath brought unto you in the time when you were in great diſtreſs, ſurely cannot be forgotten by you, but is worthy to be had in everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance: And the things which you have ſeen of this kind, and the endleſs loving-kindneſs of God unto you therein mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, is and (I hope) will be for ever ſufficient to engage you to walk with the Lord in ſingleneſs and uprightneſs of heart, that in all tryals of what nature or kind ſoever that you meet withal for the future time, you may hold faſt your teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for him, and your Faith and Confidence in him, and and be nothing daunted in your minds hearts, nor ſpirits, but in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43376:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>all things give up unto the Lord, and reſign up your Cauſe unto him alone, and he will certainly plead for you in the hearts of your Enemies, and they ſhall aſſuredly know that his controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is very great with them for your ſakes: For he hath regard unto your ſufferings, and the cryes and deep groans of his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſuffering Seed, is continually before him, and he is near to bring deliverance unto all who in patience and contentedneſs wait upon him, and that truſt in him with an upright, and with a perfect heart.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I ſay unto you all, my beloved Friends, Lambs and Babes of God, be patient, and therein wait upon God, for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh, and the day of a great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance is at hand, wherein lie will do, and bring to paſs ſuch things which cannot be believed by many, though they ſhould be told unto them: Therefore murmure not againſt the Lord in any wiſe, becauſe of theſe things which are come to paſs, and happened unto us, nor becauſe of the greatneſs of the rage of the Adverſary, for it is becauſe he hath but a very ſhort time, and though you have born long, and ſuffered much in divers kinds, and the oppreſſive yoke of Antichriſt is not yet removed nor taken away, yet I ſay, my Friends, Fear not, nor faint not in your minds, but endure to the end in the Faith and Patience of Jeſus, and when the things determined ſhall be accompliſhed, and the meaſure of iniquity ſhall be filled up, then ſhall the day of a great deliverance come unto you, and your eyes ſhall ſee <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a quiet habitation, the praiſe of the whole earth: And then ſhall the Lord God Almighty be known to reign in the Kingdoms of Men, and his Glory ſhall ſpread forth its ſelf to the ends of the world, and be declared of throughout all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Earth, and the Knowledge of God ſhall cover the Earth as the waters cover the Sea. Theſe ſayings are faithful and true, and things that muſt ſhortly come to paſs and be fulfilled, the Lord hath ſpoken it, and bleſſed are all they who believe and obey the Word of the Goſpel, and waits for the fulfilling of theſe things.</p>
            <p>VVherefore my dear Friends, dwell low in God's fear, and in his Covenant of Light into which you are gathered, and wait to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43376:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>receive his pure, Divine, Heavenly wiſdom to order you, and be you ordered thereby, and that will keep you out of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, ſo that none will be lifted up above what is meet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Promiſes of God, nor yet be caſt down becauſe of the threatnings of the Enemy, that ſo you may neither turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to the right hand, nor to the left, but that you may walk on in the even way, which is the path of peace, and feel the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life which is of God, to remain and abide in you, ſo will you be kept freſh and lively in the beauty of Truth and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſhine as Lights to the World: For you are the Salt with which the Earth muſt be ſeaſoned, and with which all things muſt be ſalted to make it ſavory unto God, &amp; acceptable unto him: For as the ſtate of the World is in which they now lie, they are unſavoury unto God, and not at all a pleaſant ſmell, neither hath he any delight in their Sacrifices, for even their prayers are abominable unto him, and their ſolemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies he hath no pleaſure in, but his ſoul even loaths and abhors them, and he will certainly work a Reformation in the Earth, and he will beat down <hi>Babylon</hi> with a mighty blow, and will bring a great deſolation upon her, &amp; amongſt her Merchants ſhall the noiſe of a great howling be heard, and all her delicacies ſhall come to nought, and all her coſtly attire (the works of cunning Workmen) ſhall be conſumed, for ſhe is come into remembrance before the Lord, and as ſhe hath loved blood, ſo muſt ſhe have blood to drink, for the Cup of God's Fury is already filled into the hands of the Saints of the Moſt High, to pour out unto her: And as ſhe hath lived deliciouſly, and glorified her ſelf, ſo much torment and ſorrow muſt ſhe have given unto her, yea ſhe ſhall have doubled unto her according to all her works, and then ſhall the Saints, Prophets and holy Apoſtles rejoice over, when God ſhall have avenged us on her.</p>
            <p>And now my beloved Friends, this I ſay unto you in and by the Spirit of the Lord, That the time haſtens and draweth nigh in which theſe things muſt be brought to paſs, yet nevertheleſs the things decreed and determined of the Lord muſt firſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed: So that although the power of darkneſs hath been long working, and doth ſtill work, as it were, in a prevalent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43376:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>manner, by which ſufferings and tribulation are brought upon us, yet I ſay, it is by the permiſſion of the hand of the Lord, that theſe things are ſo, and he hath an end in ſuffering it ſo to be, and that for his own glory, and who ſhall ſay him nay for ſo doing, or reaſon with him about matters of ſo deep concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeeing his way is hid from man, and is not known unto any, but only them unto whom he reveals it.</p>
            <p>But this my Friends, I know from the Lord, That he hath an intent and purpoſe of good unto us thereby, and why then ſhould not we all be content, and willingly ſubmit unto the hand of the Lord, whoſe Fatherly care is over all his. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Friends, though we may ſay we have ſuffered long by the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting hand of our Enemies, and their ſtroke hath fallen hard upon many of us, and that great ſufferings and afflictions ſeem ſtill to attend us, yet my Friends (bleſſed be the Lord) my heart is not at all troubled at theſe things, neither do thoughts of fear enter, becauſe I ſee the end of the Lord in it. And I know it is not contrary, but according to the determination of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that theſe things are ſo: Yet I dare not but acknowledge, that they by whom theſe ſufferings are inflicted upon us, do go beyond their bounds and commiſſion, and that is the very thing which will break them, when they have filled up their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>Wherefore my beloved brethren, be you all like-minded with me in this matter, and ſettle it in your hearts to bear all things with patience and contentedneſs, that may yet come upon you for the farther tryal of your Faith, and put on Valour, and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and Boldneſs, and be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might, and be nothing daunted before the face of your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, but let them ſee your courage in the Spirit of the Lamb, and in the Wiſdom of God: For the Lord is aſſuredly with us, and amongſt us, and will be an Enemy unto our Enemies: And what is it makes a people more dreadful and terrible, then to have the Preſence of the Lord with them? And truly Friends, this I know from the Lord, and this I have received from God, That he will yet make his people a terror to the Nations round about them, and they ſhall come bowing and bending, and ſhall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43376:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>deſire to be at a League and Covenant with all thoſe who are, and abide in Covenant with God, becauſe they ſhall know that God is with us.</p>
            <p>Therefore all my Friends, abide in that where you may have and enjoy the preſence of the Lord, and know it to continue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with you, who will be your everlaſting Comforter and your ſtay and ſtrength in all ſtates and conditions, and you will not be left comfortleſs by him, though you may be yet further tryed, and ſometimes it may be caſt down, yet you will not be forſaken that truſt in him, and repoſe confidence in him, for he will be always with you, and will give you of his Counſel and Wiſdom, by which you will be directed to walk in the path of peace, and all occaſions of ſtumbling will be removed out of the way, and you will not at all think it ſtrange that the Lord ſuffereth you ſo to be tryed, for you will ſee the end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God therein, and ſo in ſubmiſſion to his Heavenly Will in all things, you will have ſatisfaction, peace, joy and content: But if the reaſoning part enter, that will ſoon darken the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and vail the life, and the Counſel of God will be obſcure to thee, and thou wilt not ſee the end of the Lord in his thus exerciſing of thee, and then ſufferings will be grievous and hard to be born, and the murmurer will get up, that will murmure againſt God, and peace will flye from thee, and the afflicting hand of God will be upon thee alſo, becauſe of thy unfaithfulneſs, and ſuch a ſtate is worſe then his that never knew the way of Truth: Wherefore conſult not with fleſh and blood, but in patience continue to the end, in well-doing, and none to be weary therein, but be circumſpect and diligent every one in your minds and ſpirits, and watch unto prayer, that you enter not into the temptation when it cometh, for your Adverſary the Devil goeth about like a roaring Lyon, and waits to devour, and lurks to deſtroy the precious life, and will lo ſe no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that poſſibly he can get to make an enterance upon you, to deprive you of your treaſure: Wherefore I ſay, Reſiſt him ſteadfaſt in the Faith, and be you armed with the whole Armour of God, that you may be able to withſtand him in all his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, for now he wil beſtir him with all his force and might, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43376:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>will make many great oppoſitions and aſſaults both within and without, if by any means to beguile you as he did <hi>Eve</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: but as you dwell in him who is the quickening Spirit, in him the Devil hath no part, neither can he prevail there, ſo in him your ſafety is from the devourer, for he that is begotten of God into this quickening Spirit, and therein abides, he it is that keepeth himſelf, and that wicked one toucheth him not. And ſo my dear Friends, I am full of unfeigned love to you all, and my heart is indeed greatly enlarged towards you with the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and love of God which abounds in me, and not in me only, but in all the Flock of my Fathers Fold, who are faithful and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right-hearted unto him, and a Table richly deck't he hath ſpread before us in the midſt of our Enemies, and what could we more deſire then the Lord hath done for us, and promiſed to do? He hath begotten us unto himſelf, and nouriſhed and brought us up unto this ſtate in which we now ſtand, and this he hath done by his own right hand of power, and hath formed us for his praiſe, to be a peculiar people unto himſelf: And now this he requireth of every one, That you walk worthy of his Love, that it riſe not in judgement againſt any one, and that every one anſwer his requirings, and the leadings and drawings of his Spirit, ſo ſhall his Love continue with you for ever, and you ſhall be as a watered Garden, whoſe ſprings doth not fail: So to the Lord do I reſign you up, and commit you all to the Word of his Grace, who will preſerve you, and keep you thereby who truſt in him, and the Almighty Arm of God be amongſt you, and proſper and preſerve you unto his everlaſting Kingdom, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this was I moved by the Spirit of the Lord to write unto you, as a Salutation of my endeared Love unto you, and that the things that muſt ſhortly come to paſs, might be ſignified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you before-hand, and that you may be refreſhed thereby: And ſo in the Faith thereof I reſt and remain</p>

            <p>ANd Friends, not in any wiſe to forſake the aſſembling of your ſelves together, in as much as you know the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing benefit you have received thereby, and you know full well, that it was the uſual practice of the ſervants of God by whom you were begotten into the Truth, and inſtructed therein (of whom ſome remains amongſt you unto this day, and ſome are fallen aſleep) I ſay, it was their uſual manner to exhort you, and to ſtir you up to that obedience of aſſembling your ſelves together: And when did you meet together to wait upon God, and your hearts kept ſtayed upon him, but that you received your expected end? Wherefore let the remembrance of theſe things encourage you to continue in this well-doing while you have a being and liberty ſo to do: And though there were ſuch in ages paſt, whoſe manner was to forſake the aſſembling of themſelves together, and ſome ſuch there are at this day alſo: Yet my Friends, let not them be your example to walk by, but every one to walk as you had and have them for examples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you who begat you into the truth, and by whom the Way of Life hath been made known unto you, &amp; be ye followers of them even as they were, &amp; are of Chriſt: For this my Friends I ſay unto you, There are ſome ſprung up amongſt us who have in effect, laboured to diſſwade Friends from their uſual way and manner of meeting and aſſembling together, with whoſe Spirit and proceedings therein we have not unity, but muſt in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt Jeſus the Lamb of God, give teſtimony againſt them, and forewarn you not to receive that Spirit which goeth about to divert you from your uſual way and manner of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling together, in which you have had the comfort of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, and received the Juſtification of Life, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43376:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>thereby your growth hath been much added unto: So that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly my Friends, that Spirit which would turn you aſide from this godly practiſe (of aſſembling together) is a dangerous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and is not of God, whatſoever it pretend, or though it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſelf with never ſo fair expreſſions. Wherefore my dear Friends, have Salt within you to ſavour withal, and keep your firſt Love, and your firſt Faith, through which you received life eternal; and hold faſt your firſt ſimplicity, and your former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and gad not abroad to change your ways, but meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Name and Fear of the Lord, as your wonted man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hath been, ſo ſhall you find the preſence of God with you in your Aſſemblies, as in the days paſt, and his wonted goodneſs and love you will feel, which will warm your hearts, and refreſh your ſouls, by which you will be kept living unto him, and a good ſavour, and be to the praiſe of his Name, who is God over all bleſſed for ever.</p>

            <head>To all that believe in Chriſt.</head>
            <p>YE that believe in Chriſt Jeſus the Light of the World, and are convinced of the way of God's Truth, and know it by his Light in your own Conſciences, continue all of you in this Faith, and be ſtedfaſt in it all your days, and let there be no neglect in any of you of meeting together, but approve your hearts to God, &amp; to his people, in this thing of aſſembling your ſelves together to wait upon the Lord, for it is his will thus to do, and it is according to the example of the Saints in former days, and it is according to our practice who are the firſt fruits to God, and to the Lamb, in this laſt age, and by the Spirit of the Lord, and in the Name and Power of Chriſt Jeſus, we have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43376:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>given example therein, and inſtruction and exhortation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, again and again, even that all that believe in Jeſus, and are convinced of his Truth in their Conſciences, ſhould aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves together once or twice a Week, or as the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God teacheth, for in ſuch practice of ſo meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we have found much of the Lords preſence many times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing our ſouls, yea many have received of the Lord in their Aſſemblings together, the ſence, and virtue, and peace of the Lord in an unexpreſſible manner, and we can certifie to all, that it is the way of the Lord, and he is found in it, when people are turned to the gift of the Spirit of Chriſt in them, in their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings the Lord deſcendeth amongſt them, every one being turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their own, then the Lord is near unto them: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore again and again I exhort all, Meet together in the Name of Jeſus, and you will find the Life, Peace and Comfort of Jeſus amongſt you: For if any being convinced, and believing, and will not aſſemble themſelves together, it ſhews ſuch to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, negligent, and of a careleſs heart, and not regarding the honor of the Lord, nor their own peace, and amongſt the diſobedient muſt ſuch be accounted, when the Lord comes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward every one according to their works: And foraſmuch as this very thing of our meeting together is become the main con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croverſie at this day between us and them that would deſtroy us, and out of their envy againſt God and his People, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the way of his Truth, do they contend againſt us in this caſe: Therefore as ye love the Cauſe of God, and would have it prevail againſt its Enemies, and as ye would not give the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked one that occaſion to ſay he hath overcomed, and as ye would not give God's Cauſe into his Enemies hand, I ſay unto you, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect not to meet together, that the Lord may delight to dwell with you, and to reveal the Myſterie of his glory unto you, and that the Enemy of his Truth may be overcome both within and without: And hereby ſhall all know you to be the Lord's People, and that he hath a people that will ſerve him above the fear of this World.</p>
